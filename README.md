# Heroes of the Storm Bingo Generator
https://dstockhammer.github.io/heroes-bingo

## What is this thing?
A web-based [Heroes of the Storm](http://eu.battle.net/heroes/en/) themed [Bingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(U.S.)) board generator.

## But why is the implementation so crappy?
This is a proof of concept hacked together in little time while watching HGC. It was intended as a throw-away for personal use, but it actually turned out quite alright. If I'm not the only person using this, I might improve the implementation to play a bit nicer with DOM. There are also a couple more features and general improvements that I can think of, so if it turns out that people are indeed using this, I might dedicate some more time to make it a little better.
